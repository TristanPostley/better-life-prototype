# Project Conventions

This directory contains documentation of the conventions and patterns used throughout the Better Life project. These conventions help maintain consistency, improve code quality, and guide future development.

## Convention Documents

- **[Folder Structure](folder-structure.md)** - Directory organization and file placement rules
- **[Naming Conventions](naming-conventions.md)** - How to name files, functions, variables, and types
- **[Error Handling](error-handling.md)** - Standardized error handling patterns
- **[Imports and Dependencies](imports-and-dependencies.md)** - Module import patterns and dependency management
- **[Client-Server Boundaries](client-server-boundaries.md)** - Separation between client and server code
- **[Testing Organization](testing-organization.md)** - Test file structure and testing patterns
- **[Domain Structure](DOMAIN_STRUCTURE_PROPOSAL.md)** - Domain-driven design organization
- **[Domain Structure Tree](DOMAIN_STRUCTURE_TREE.md)** - Visual representation of domain organization
- **[Migration Status](MIGRATION_STATUS.md)** - Current migration state and progress

## Purpose

These conventions serve as:

1. **Reference Documentation** - Quick lookup for how things should be done
2. **Onboarding Guide** - Help new contributors understand the codebase
3. **Consistency Enforcement** - Ensure all code follows the same patterns
4. **Decision Record** - Document why certain patterns were chosen

## When to Update

Update these documents when:

- New patterns emerge that should be standardized
- Existing patterns are refactored or improved
- Inconsistencies are discovered and resolved
- New conventions are established through team discussion

## Note on Inconsistencies

Some areas of the codebase may not yet follow these conventions consistently. The documents note where conventions are:
- **Consistently followed** - Pattern is well-established
- **Partially followed** - Some code follows, some doesn't
- **Not yet established** - No clear pattern exists yet
